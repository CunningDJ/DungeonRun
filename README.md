DungeonRun
==========

Dungeon Run is a fast-paced, two-player game where you run around level upon level in a dungeon, collecting coins and avoiding restless monsters!
Each player tries to collect as many points as possible while not getting killed.

# Notes

- Arrow keys move Player 1, WASD moves player two (same arrangement as the arrow keys).
- Run to the door to progress to the next level.
- + (plus) and - (minus) on the keypad will accelerate and decelerate (respectively) the players and monsters.
- The points and end game score can currently be seen in the window header.
- The most recent code is in the top-level DungeonRun.py script, but stable versions with less features are in the version_release folders.
